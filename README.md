# FixturesList

Welcome to my Big 3 soccer leagues fixture schedule gem! With this gem you will see the upcoming games for the biggest leagues in world soccer including the opponents, the time, and the location where the game will be played.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'fixtures_list'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fixtures_list

## Usage

You can interact with this program by choosing which league you would like to view by number.
Then you can choose to re-list the leagues and choose again. Or you may blow the final whistle on the program to exit.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
